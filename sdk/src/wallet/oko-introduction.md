# Overview

Welcome to Oko! 👋

![Oko Welcome](/img/oko-welcome.png)

Web3 onboarding does not need to be complicated. Oko makes onboarding to your application easy, fast, and secure. No wallet installs, no recovery phrases, no friction. It is a fully open source embedded wallet stack that teams can self host, inspect, and customize from end to end.

Oko integrates the security of non custodial wallets directly into any web or mobile application. Users sign up with familiar login methods like email or social, while the wallet keys are protected by a distributed TSS plus SSS architecture. Private keys are never constructed, never stored, and never accessible by any single party.

## Why Oko[​](#why-oko "Direct link to Why Oko")

One of the biggest challenges in crypto is managing wallets across multiple chains. Keplr (the team behind Oko) has solved this with **a browser extension** that empowers users to securely self-custody their assets and connect effortlessly to dApps across ecosystems.

However, onboarding remains one of the biggest barriers for users who are less familiar with crypto. In Web3, the core advantage is that users bring their own wallet to every application—unlike Web2, where accounts are tied to individual platforms. But this Web3 model introduces two major challenges:

* Managing recovery phrases or private keys
* Installing browser extensions or mobile apps

Embedded wallets aim to remove these hurdles by providing a smoother entry point. Yet, existing solutions sacrifice one of Web3’s defining strengths: *interoperability across applications and blockchains*. They tend to create isolated accounts for each application, essentially reverting to a Web2-style model.

**Oko** solves this by providing an embedded onboarding flow that still preserves the interoperability of a global wallet address. Developers keep full control of the integration because everything from client to server is open source under Apache 2.0. Teams can run Oko entirely on their own infrastructure or choose official integration to use enterprise grade key share nodes and dashboards.
