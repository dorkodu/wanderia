Here's a **structured implementation roadmap** based on the earlier feedback. This is formatted as clear, numbered instructions you (or any LLM or team member) can follow to execute effectively.

---

## üß± I. Foundation & Vision

### 1. **Clarify Wanderia's Vision**

- Write a short, bold mission (e.g. ‚ÄúWanderia empowers regenerative communities with social money, utility tokens, and AI agents.‚Äù)
- Define: Who is it for? (crypto-native communities? builders? solana-native DAOs?)
- List 3‚Äì5 clear goals for next 6 months (MVP, first users, token launchpad live)

---

## üõ† II. MVP Product Architecture

### 2. **Define the Core Modules**

Break MVP into 5 technical pillars:

| Pillar                 | Feature                                | Tools/Libraries                              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Identity & Access      | Wallets, Embedded Key Mgmt             | `@solana/wallet-adapter`, custom Privy clone |
| Community Hub          | Feeds, Profiles, Token-gated Chat      | React + Tailwind + Helius                    |
| Token Launchpad        | Utility Token Creation, Bonding Curves | Anchor, SPL, Jupiter hooks                   |
| Contribution & Rewards | Task system, Karma, Onchain Actions    | Cronos, Lido task engines, custom            |
| AI Agents              | Community agents (chat, execution)     | OpenRouter, OSS agents like Eliza-OS, AIXBT  |

---

## üîÅ III. Tokenomics & Launchpad

### 3. **Token Launch Framework**

- Decide between **fixed supply** vs **bonding curve**
- Choose bonding curve shape (e.g. sigmoid or flat-linear growth)
- Lock team tokens for 1 year
- Revenue model: transaction fees on token launch + swap + staking

> üìò You can model after Believe App or Pump.fun, but shift from memecoin to utility alignment.

### 4. **Builder Playbook**

- Write a simple PDF/Notion guide for creators:
  - What is a utility token?
  - How to define use cases?
  - Example: Local access pass, contribution reward, governance
  - How bonding curve works and grows value
  - How to avoid over-promising and under-delivering

---

## üì£ IV. Go-to-Market Strategy

### 5. **Find Early Projects/Communities**

- Identify 10 potential projects that might use Wanderia
- DM founders, explain what you‚Äôre building, offer **launch partner perks**
- Use platforms like:
  - Solana Hacker Houses
  - Farcaster/Backchannel
  - Twitter (look for active ‚Äúbuilder‚Äù or ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù accounts)

---

## üí∏ V. Fundraising Prep

### 6. **Raise a Pre-Seed Round**

- Ideal target: **\$250K‚Äì\$500K**
- Use SAFE or token warrant (delayed delivery)
- Budget:
  - \$100k founder salary for 12mo
  - \$150k dev/design hires
  - \$100k runway, infra, ops

- Target VCs/angels:
  - IDEO, Collab+Currency, 1kx, Archetype, Balaji, Jess Sloss, Jordi (Zora), Meow (Jupiter)

> üéØ You only need one great believer at this stage.

---

## üìÑ VI. Materials for Investors

### 7. **Build the Investor Pack**

Deliverables:

- 1-page Wanderia Vision doc (clear, exciting, emotionally resonant)
- Deck (10 slides):
  - Problem
  - Solution
  - Product Demo (screens or prototype)
  - Market
  - Model
  - Roadmap
  - Team
  - Ask

- Notion/Data Room:
  - Tokenomics
  - Roadmap
  - Budget breakdown
  - Dev plan

---

## üîé VII. Risks & Weak Points (and Solutions)

| Risk                                    | Solution                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Too broad product                       | Start narrow: only token launchpad + community hub MVP                       |
| Wallet UX on mobile                     | Prioritize embedded key solution (Privy clone)                               |
| Over-focus on vision, under on delivery | Build working prototype fast ‚Äî even ugly is okay                             |
| Misaligned token incentives             | Use fair curve + locked team tokens                                          |
| No users                                | Dogfood with 1‚Äì3 small communities (test + refine)                           |
| Confused brand                          | Simplify copywriting. Always write like you're explaining to your past self. |

## üß™ VIII. Execute MVP

### 8. **Work in Weekly Milestones**

Set 6-week sprint:

1. Week 1-2: Token launchpad scaffolding (smart contracts + frontend)
2. Week 3-4: Identity + wallet infra (embedded + connect)
3. Week 5: Contribution + karma engine
4. Week 6: First community setup + test token

---

## üß¨ IX. AI Agent Module

### 9. **Standalone Agent Framework**

- Use OSS like Eliza-OS, AIXBT, Auto-GPT forks
- Functions:
  - Chat with community members
  - Summarize and answer forum/chat data
  - Help with onboarding, governance, token uses

- Optional: let users _customize_ agent personas

---

## üîÅ X. Feedback Loop & Launch

### 10. **Test ‚Üí Iterate ‚Üí Launch**

- Launch closed alpha with 3 communities
- Collect qualitative + product analytics data
- Add token support, fix UX, polish
- Open beta on Solana Hacker House or Twitter launch
