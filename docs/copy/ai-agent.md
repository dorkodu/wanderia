Great instinct—**AI agents as sovereign community coordinators** is a standout differentiator for Wanderia and deserves its own section. Here's how you can structure this into a full **landing page section**, with compelling content, layout suggestions, and optional expansion ideas:

---

## 💡 SECTION TITLE: _Sovereign AI Agents, Aligned With Your Community_

---

### 🧠 Headline:

**Your community’s own AI—custom-trained, onchain-native, and mission-aligned.**

---

### ✍️ Subheadline:

Forget generic chatbots. Wanderia lets every project spawn its own AI agent that understands your values, your contributors, and your token economy—turning conversation into coordination.

---

### 🧩 Feature Bullets:

- **Context-aware & mission-driven**
  Trained on your community’s chats, docs, contributions, and goals. Your agent helps newcomers onboard, keeps builders focused, and guides decision-making.

- **Built on open AI infrastructure**
  Inspired by Virtuals, aixbt, Griffain, and ElizaOS—but open, decentralized, and deeply integrated with your project’s token, tasks, and governance.

- **Your AI, your rules**
  Customize your agent’s personality, knowledge scope, access levels, and behaviors. Train it on your GitHub, Discord, Farcaster, and more.

- **Token-native intelligence**
  Agents understand your token mechanics, karma systems, and bonding curves. They can explain it, manage it, and even recommend treasury actions.

- **Composable & sovereign**
  Every agent is deployable, forkable, and verifiable. Run locally, connect via API, or bring it into your app, your site, your DAO.

### 🎥 (Optional Visual Ideas):

- Animated mockup of a chat interface:
  “Hey WanderBot, how can I earn XP today?” → \[AI shows 3 open tasks tied to bounties]

- Split layout:
  Left: Screenshot of a custom AI agent panel
  Right: Live stats or sample prompt / response showing token- and user-aware intelligence

---

### 🧱 Optional Call-To-Action:

**Every community deserves an intelligence layer. Launch yours with one click.**

Button: `⚙️ Create My Agent` → Leads to agent config wizard

---

### ⚙️ Add-Ons You Could Build:

- AI agent profile pages (public + private dashboard)
- Fine-tuning via prompt engineering UI
- Plugin system for DAO governance, treasury ops, onboarding flows
- Memory store based on open protocols like Nostr, Farcaster, ATProto
- Secure inference via Lit Protocol, zkEmail, or MPC (optional)

---

Let me know if you'd like me to:

- Design a UI layout mockup
- Name the AI system (e.g. _WanderBot_, _Sentinel_, _Ethos_, etc.)
- Write developer docs or SDK structure for this feature

This section could be your **signature feature**—the "smart soul" of the Wanderia experience.
