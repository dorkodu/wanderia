### ⚖️ Why Wanderia?

- **Rediscover Money as a Social Technology**
  Money is more than fiat—it shapes culture, coordination, and intent. Communities now reclaim financial agency and craft currencies aligned with their values ([meow.bio][1]).

- **Infinite Tokens, Finite Purpose**
  You don’t need millions of tokens to succeed—just one that breathes life into shared purpose. Every token is a tiny social experiment, potentially powerful and purpose-driven.

- **Abundance Through Design**
  Multiple tokens coexist and thrive when they enhance one another. Community richness breeds ecosystem strength .
