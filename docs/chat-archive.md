# 🧠 Wanderia Development Archive (Chat Log Summary in Markdown)

## 📍 Overview

**Wanderia** is a regenerative social platform enabling communities to launch tokens, reward contributions, and coordinate using embedded AI agents. Built with a Solana-first mindset and integrating multiple decentralized protocols, it’s a convergence of crypto-native identity, community OS, and regenerative token engineering.

This document summarizes our full conversation, ideation, architecture, and roadmap drafts as of July 2025.

## 🔮 Vision, Mission, Naming

**Name:** Wanderia

**Mission:** Empower regenerative communities with social money, utility tokens, and AI agents — all interoperable across Solana, Farcaster, Nostr, ATProto.

**Core Idea:** Wanderia isn’t just a protocol — it’s the easiest way to launch your own community’s economy, powered by AI and crypto-native infra.

## 🧱 Protocols & Technologies

- **Chain:** Solana (cheap txns, high throughput)
- **Identity:** `did:wander:`, Solana Pubkey-based DID system
- **Messaging:** Dialect, Nostr (bridge), or native pubsub
- **Agents:** Eliza-OS / OpenRouter / AutoGPT-like shells
- **Other Infra:**
  - Jupiter SDK (token swap UI)
  - Helius (indexing)
  - LiveKit / Dialect for real-time
  - Tailwind + React + ShadCN

## 💰 Token Design

### 🎯 Use Cases

- Launch community tokens in <5 mins
- Reward participation (votes, content, help)
- Use tokens in quests, bounties, tipping

### 🧮 Mechanics

- Choose fixed supply or bonding curve (sigmoid / flat)
- Optional stake-based access
- Fees + redistribution to creators and DAO

### 🪙 Tokenomics Roles

- Community Token = local money
- Wander = protocol utility token (optional)
- Karma = contribution points (soulbound, maybe)

---

## 🤖 AI Agents in Wanderia

**Purpose:** Serve each community with a dedicated assistant

| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Onboarding Bot    | Help members get wallets, tokens              |
| Token Guide       | Explains bonding curve, tokenomics            |
| Community Manager | Answers questions, moderates, suggests quests |
| Summarizer        | Condenses threads, decisions, proposals       |

**Tech:** Wrapper around OpenRouter / GPT-4o + plugins

## 📣 Go-to-Market

**Audience:**

- Regen DAOs, startup groups, tokenized communities
- Solana builders, Farcaster groups

**Strategies:**

- Soft launch with 3 founding communities
- Partner with dev-rel (Solana Hacker House, Twitter Spaces)
- Bundle token, task rewards, and AI agent as “community OS”

---

## 💸 Fundraising

**Target:** \$250–500K Pre-seed

**Instruments:** SAFE + Token Warrant

**Use of Funds:**

- \$100k → Founder salary
- \$150k → Dev/design contracts
- \$100–250k → Ops, infra, marketing

**Investors:**

- Angels: Balaji, Jess Sloss, Meow
- Funds: 1kx, IDEO, Archetype, Collab+Currency

**Pitch Assets:**

- 1-pager vision
- Deck (10 slides)
- Token design doc
- Builder Playbook
- Technical Architecture Overview

## 🧠 Weaknesses & Strategy Fixes

| Weakness           | Fix                                    |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Vision too broad   | Start with Token Launch + Rewards only |
| No usable wallet   | Use embedded or gasless onboarding     |
| Speculative design | Emphasize use-case first tokens        |
| Misuse of tokens   | Build constraints into launch UI       |
| No live users      | Build with 3 design partners live      |

---

## ✅ Action Plan

**Key Deliverables:**

- [x] Roadmap (done)
- [ ] Token Design Sheet
- [ ] MVP UI Sketches
- [ ] Builder Playbook
- [ ] Fundraising Deck
- [ ] Agent Persona Templates

**Immediate Next Steps:**

1. Finalize Launch UI for tokens
2. Launch first test community (e.g. Trekie or Regen org)
3. Prepare fundraising materials

---

## 🏁 Final Notes

- Wanderia is the OS for regenerative community economies
- MVP = start simple: tokens, rewards, agents
- All infra must be **usable without technical knowledge**
- Build like Apple, think like Ethereum, feel like Discord
