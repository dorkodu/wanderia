Here's a refined version of the **optimal token launch framework** for Wanderia, inspired by pump.fun but tailored for **purpose-built utility tokens and regenerative communities**:

---

## 🧪 1. Bonding Curve Mechanics

Use a **step-function bonding curve with smooth transitions**, similar to pump.fun’s discrete curve:

```text
price(supply) = a + b × supply + c × supply²
```

- **Initial reserves** (e.g. 30 SOL & 1B tokens) start the virtual liquidity pool ([binance.com][1], [beincrypto.com][2])
- Early token purchases are cheap; price rises gradually with each step ([hashherald.com][3])
- The model ensures always-on liquidity and a predictable user experience ([reddit.com][4])

---

## ⏳ 2. Graduation & LP Lock

Define a **graduation threshold** (e.g. 50–100 SOL raised):

- Once hit, **lock and burn** LP tokens on Raydium to guarantee permanent liquidity ([hashherald.com][3])
- _Example_: lock 70 SOL + tokens, burn LP to secure community trust

---

## ⚖️ 3. Token Allocation Rules

| Pool                         | % of Sync Supply | Vesting                     |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| Bonding Curve                | 60–80%           | Launchable gradually        |
| Founders & Treasury          | 10–20%           | 6–24m vesting, 6m cliff     |
| Community Rewards/Incentives | 10–20%           | Unlocks via tasks, bounties |
| Referral and Outreach        | 2–5%             | Bonus on participation      |

Total supply typically \~1 billion tokens

---

## 💵 4. Fees, Buy-back & Sustainability

- **Issuance fee**: \~0.02 SOL on launch, paid by first buyer ([finpr.agency][5])
- **Transaction fee**: \~1% on bonding trades & sales:
  - 50% → project treasury
  - 50% → platform & community pool ([reddit.com][6], [hashherald.com][3])

- **Buy-back & burn**: Automated with treasury revenue to stabilize token price

---

## 🛡️ 5. Anti-Whale & Fair Launch Protections

- **Per-wallet caps**: e.g. 2 SOL in first 24 h
- **Bot protection**: whitelist early participants, delay trade periods
- **Referral bonuses**: e.g. +5% tokens to referrer upon meeting task thresholds

---

## 🗳️ 6. Governance & Role Transition

- After graduation, enable **DAO governance**:
  - Token-based voting (e.g. quadratic voting)
  - Community control over treasury and tokenomic adjustments
  - Smart contract hooks allow changes via proposal outcome

---

## 🎯 7. UX Summary Flow

1. **Configure Launch**: Configure token details, supply, bonding formula, vesting
2. **Reveal Launch Page**: Show dynamic bonding curve graph and caps
3. **Liquidity Stage**: Public buys tokens along curve; price and supply adjust
4. **Threshold Reached**: Graduation triggers LP lock and public listing
5. **Operations Post-Launch**: Earn via contributions, DAO governance, continuous buy-backs

---

## 📈 8. Why It's Effective for Utility Tokens

- **Predictable Discovery**: Bonding curve ensures liquidity and transparent pricing ([academy.binance.com][7], [theblock101.com][8], [binance.com][1], [ledger.com][9], [bitbond.com][10])
- **Early Incentives, Sustainable Growth**: Early adopters rewarded; buy-backs and utility drive long-term value
- **Trust through Locking**: LP burn ensures safety and builds confidence ([theblock101.com][8])
- **Aligns with Social Money Ethos**: Enables regenerative, community-aligned currencies without speculation

---

## 🛠️ Next Steps

- 💻 Build Anchor-based smart contracts implementing curve & graduation flows
- 🎨 Design React UI for bonding launch, dynamic charts, and cap enforcement
- 🧩 Integrate this launch module into Wanderia with task-to-token pipelines
