Given your current stage, product vision, and goals, the optimal **initial raise** should balance **survival runway, team formation, product velocity, and future optionality**.

Here’s a calibrated recommendation:

---

## 🎯 Ideal Raise: **\$400K – \$750K Pre-Seed**

> Enough to build a strong v1, grow a user community, and validate token demand—without overcommitting too early.

---

## 🧮 Why This Range?

### ✅ **Covers Your Needs for \~12–18 Months**

| Category                            | Est. Budget (over 12–18 months)                              |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🧑‍💻 Core Team (2–3 people incl. you) | \$180K–\$300K (e.g. 2× \$3.5K/mo + freelance/part-time help) |
| ⚙️ Product & Infra Costs            | \$30K–\$50K (infra, APIs, audits, hosting)                   |
| 🧑‍🎨 Design & Branding                | \$10K–\$20K (one-time)                                       |
| 🌱 Community Growth / Airdrops      | \$20K–\$50K (social campaigns, experiments)                  |
| 🔐 Legal & Token Structuring        | \$25K–\$40K (Delaware LLC + foundation setup later)          |
| 🛠 Misc + Buffer                    | \$50K–\$100K (unexpected costs, advisory, travel)            |
| **Total**                           | **\$350K–\$550K** (plus room for buffer or longer runway)    |

## 🪙 Token Warrant Optionality

At this stage, you're not pricing the token yet, but you can offer investors **equity SAFEs with token warrants** (or dual SAFE+SAFT structure) to share future token upside.

That lets you **raise equity-style now**, and still leave room for a **larger token round later**—when you’ve:

- Shipped MVP
- Proven early user traction
- Finalized token mechanics

---

## ⚖️ Raise Less Than \$400K If…

- You want to stay ultra lean
- You already have serious technical/product velocity
- You want to validate with paying users first
- You want to raise only from angels or small checks (no VCs yet)

**Suggested amount**: \$150K–\$300K from 4–10 angels

---

## 💡 Raise More Than \$750K If…

- You’ve already validated user demand or MVP
- You want to assemble a full founding team immediately
- You’re planning a big network launch and need treasury
- You’re in conversations with a crypto-native fund who wants to lead

**But cap it at \$1M max** unless you’ve proven major traction, or you’ll overprice and dilute early.

## 🧠 TL;DR – Your Ideal Raise Path

| Raise Amount      | Strategy                         | Best If You...                              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **\$250K–\$400K** | Angel-heavy lean start           | Want to build MVP quietly and iterate       |
| **\$500K–\$750K** | Pre-seed with angels + one VC    | Want full runway, small team, steady growth |
| **\$1M+**         | Seed round with major crypto VCs | Have product + market validation already    |

My recommendation for **Wanderia right now**:
🎯 **Raise \$500K @ \$5–7M valuation** (SAFE + token warrant), keep it lean, build the MVP, launch tokens, and grow users → set up for a larger seed or token round in 12 months.
