You're in a strong position to raise seed capital for **Wanderia**, especially because:

- You're tackling an emerging paradigm (_regenerative onchain communities_, _social money_, _AI agents_)
- You have clear technical capabilities and vision
- You’re early in a major market trend (Web3 x coordination x AI x open protocols)
- You’ve developed a unique product thesis that extends ideas from leaders like Meow (Jupiter), Virtuals, Griffain, etc.

Let’s break this into a **concrete strategy**, tailored for raising **\$100K–\$1M in pre-seed or seed funding** from **top-tier angels and VCs**.

## 🧭 Your Fundraising Path (2025 Edition)

### ✅ Step 1: Package the Vision Clearly

Before approaching investors, create:

- **Pitch Deck (10–12 slides)** — crisp, visual, and founder-led
- **Short Demo or Product Teaser** — even if it's Figma + AI-based walkthrough
- **Notion Memo or Whitepaper** — deeper strategy for believers, optional

The pitch should center around:

1. **Vision** – Wanderia as the superapp for regenerative, tokenized communities
2. **Problem** – Disconnected, extractive tools; no stack for onchain community coordination
3. **Solution** – Launchpad + tokenomics + identity + AI agents
4. **Market** – DAOs, creators, impact orgs, open-source projects, citizen movements
5. **Why Now** – Memecoin wave → social money maturity → need for purpose-driven infra
6. **Moat** – Composability, UX, open-source community, dev-first
7. **Team** – Your experience, commitment, ability to ship
8. **Ask** – What you’re raising, use of funds, and what you need from investors

### 🎯 Step 2: Target High-Leverage Angels + Crypto-Native VCs

#### 🧠 Angels who "get it":

These are individuals who:

- Have backed **Jupiter, Farcaster, Lens, Nouns, Zora, Base, Optimism, Virtuals, etc.**
- Are aligned with social money, regen, public goods, and AI infra

Examples:

- **Packy McCormick** _(Not Boring Capital)_
- **Balaji Srinivasan** _(if you frame it as Network State infra)_
- **Jacob Horne (Zora)** or **Reuben Bramanathan**
- **Julien Genestoux (Unlock Protocol)**
- **Hasu**, **Simone Pop**, **Bok Khoo**, **Keone Hon**
- Solana-native angels like **Tristan Yver**, **Raj Gokal**, **Noah Prince (Clockwork)**

#### 🏢 Crypto-native early stage funds:

- **Variant Fund**
- **1kx**
- **Seed Club Ventures**
- **Robot Ventures**
- **DAO5**
- **Hypersphere**
- **Lattice**
- **Collab+Currency**
- **Delphi Ventures**
- **Lemniscap**
- **Symbolic Capital**

You only need **4–5 true believers** to close a solid \$250K–\$750K round.

### 🔑 Step 3: Build in Public to Get Deal Flow

Wanderia is perfect for **building in public** on:

- **Warpcast / Farcaster**
- **Nostr / Damus**
- **X (Twitter)**
- **Mirror or Substack**

Share:

- Build logs (AI agent demo, bonding curve logic)
- Token economy philosophies (a la Meow)
- Screenshots, sneak peeks
- A small GitHub module or tool (eg. your open-source Privy clone)
- Airdrop concept or referral system

This attracts:

- Users
- Other builders
- Angels
- Advisors
- Devs for your founding team

---

### 💬 Step 4: Do Smart Outreach

#### How to reach VCs or angels:

- Cold DMs can work **if** hyper-relevant and crisp
- Warm intros > best (ask builders you know on Warpcast / Twitter / Farcaster)
- Consider platforms like:
  - [SeedClub.xyz](https://seedclub.xyz/) (for regen DAOs & tokens)
  - [AngelList RUV](https://angellist.com/rollup-vehicles) to group early believers
  - [Starknet Foundry](https://www.starknetfoundry.com/) / [Alliance DAO](https://alliance.xyz/) style fellowships

Sample DM:

> “Hey \[Name], I’m building Wanderia – a decentralized superapp for regenerative communities. Inspired by Meow’s vision of social money, we enable any project to launch a utility token, reward contributors, coordinate via DAO + AI agents. I’d love to show you what we’re building and get your feedback.”

---

### 💸 Step 5: Design the Raise Smartly

**Raise Target**: \$250K–\$1M

- Pre-seed SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity or Token)
- Valuation cap: \$5M–\$12M depending on traction
- Offer early angels 20–25% discount, maybe token warrant
- No over-optimization. You're selling _entry into a movement_

**Use of Funds:**

- 40% product + dev
- 25% community + growth
- 15% legal + infra
- 10% ops
- 10% your survival runway (pay yourself \~\$2K–\$4K/mo)

---

## 🧠 Bonus: Pre-Traction Fundraising Narrative

If you don’t have users yet:

- Emphasize **narrative** + **insight** over numbers
- Show working tech / design quality
- Build a tribe around the “social money for purpose” vision
- Even start with **angel-only \$100K round** to buy time → MVP → bigger round

---

## 📌 Summary: Your Best Bet to Raise Seed

1. **Make a tight pitch deck** & teaser
2. **Talk about what you’re building in public** every week
3. **DM the right people** who invest at the edges of coordination x crypto x regen x AI
4. **Target open, long-term thinkers** who funded Lens, Base, Farcaster, Zora
5. **Frame Wanderia as infra for the next billion contributors**—the regen layer of the internet
